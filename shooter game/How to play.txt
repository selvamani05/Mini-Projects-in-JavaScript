You are Cupid now. Shoot arrows at the hearts!
The faster you shoot all the hearts, the better your score.
But be warned: if you hit any particular heart more than once, it will break! 
Your score will be lowered by the passing of time as well as every miss and every broken heart.
The game ends when all the hearts have been shot.
Good luck!
